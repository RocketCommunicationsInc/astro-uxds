# Switch

A Switch toggles between two mutually exclusive states such as "On" or "Off." Unlike a checkbox, a switch initiates an action with immediate effect without requiring a "Save" or "Submit" action.

## Rules of Thumb

- Use a switch for immediate state changes between two mutually exclusive options.
- For non-immediate changes, use [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) for mutually exclusive options or [checkboxes](/components/checkbox) for non-exclusive options.
- For immediate actions instead of state changes, use an [action button](/components/button).
- On a page, each switch is independent of all other switches.
- An intelligent default should be set for the initial state of a switch.

## Appearance and Behavior

A switch consists of a circular button that slides across a track to display the "Off" (left) or "On" (right) state. Clicking anywhere on the switch component will cause the switch to change states immediately.
