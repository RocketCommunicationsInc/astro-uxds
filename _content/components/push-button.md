# Push Button

Push buttons are a variant of the Switch that incorporate label and action into a single user interface element. Push buttons may provide a useful interface element where screen real-estate is at a premium.

## Appearance and Behavior

To learn more about adding Help Text to Push Buttons or Push Button groups, see the [Forms and Validation](/patterns/forms-and-validation) guidance.
