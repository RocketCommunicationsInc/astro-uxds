# Select Menu

When activated, Select Menus allow users to select a value from a list of values. Once a value is selected, the Select Menu displays the selected value.

## Rules of Thumb

- Select Menus should display a list of multiple values.
- Select Menus may default to a state that instructs users what to do. For example: “Select Modem” or a default choice like “Modem X.”
- When the user knows what they’re looking for in advance, consider using a text field with client-side auto-complete functionality instead.

## Examples
