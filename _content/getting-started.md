# Getting Started

Astro is a design system that brings together UX guidelines, an [HTML/CSS](/components/readme) framework, and web components. Astro is for both designers and developers.

Astro is provided by the United States Space Force and Missile System Center (SMC) and is currently sanctioned for designing Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) and SATOPS web apps.

Astro’s user-centered design approach includes interviews and design validation with many SMC and commercial space systems operators. By incorporating operators and subject matter experts in our research and gaining their feedback during the design process, Astro ensures future space apps meet the needs of their users. Refer to the information provided in the [Research](/design-process/research) page for more information on incorporating a user-centered approach in your designs.

Astro’s designs stem from continuous exploration and research. Astro includes standard HTML and CSS sample code as a starting point for development. Astro’s UI Components are provided as Web Components, a platform neutral technology. While the Astro Components are not production-ready code, they do provide a blueprint of intended behavior and interaction to facilitate integration into your development workflow.

Astro is a living design system, created and stewarded by [Rocket Communications Inc.](https://rocketcom.com/) in San Francisco. For questions, contact Rocket at: UXsupport@rocketcom.com.
