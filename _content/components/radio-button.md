# Radio Button

Radio Buttons allow users to mutually select an option from a predefined set of options. When one selection is made, the previous selection becomes deselected. One option should always be selected.

## Rules of Thumb

- Use Radio Buttons for mutually exclusive choices. If user can make more than one choice use Checkboxes.
- Radio Buttons appear in groups of two or more.
- One option should always be selected.
- Use Radio Buttons when two to six choices are available. If displaying more than six items, consider using a Select Menu.
- Don’t use a Radio Button to initiate an action.
- Lay out lists of Radio Buttons vertically with one choice per line.
- Accurately label a group of Radio Buttons to describe the choices.
- Give each Radio Button a text label that describes the choice it represents.
- If you use more than one word in a text label, be sure to use title-style capitalization.

::: note
If a user is required to make a choice between items without a default, consider a Select Menu.
