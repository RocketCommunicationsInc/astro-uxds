# Segmented Button

Segmented Buttons allow users to select one item at a time from two to four options. Selecting one option automatically turns off the last selection made. Segmented Buttons are mutually exclusive.

## Rules of Thumb

- Use Segmented Buttons: 
  - To filter a grid or table. 
  - To switch a view's display mode.
- One option must always be selected.

## Appearance and Behavior

To learn more about adding Help Text to form elements like Segmented Buttons, see the [Forms and Validation](/patterns/forms-and-validation) guidance.
