# Spectrum Analyzer

Often called “Spec-A”, Spectrum Analysis diagrams display power levels over a specific band.

This live component simulates a classic "Spec-A" display, traditionally implemented in hardware, that is so often seen in SATCOM and other space domain applications.

The display updates at two frames per second and draws data from a standard web socket.

This component is highly customizable for bandwidth, power range, and labeling. See the Web Component documentation for detailed information on these settable properties.
