# Tabs

Tabs in Astro Applications are used to divide major areas of content and to indicate work process.

## Rules of Thumb

- Use only one row of Tabs.
- Use Higher Level Tabs only on top of the panel.
- Tab labels should not be more than two words and should accurately reflect what underlying content the user can expect to reveal.
- Use title-style capitalization for labels.
- High level tabs are often used to organize an application by work process.

:::note note High Level Tabs are often process/workflow oriented. Process oriented tabs should:

- Appear in the upper left quadrant.
- Be clearly labeled.
- Guide users through a sequential process.

:::

## Interior/Compact Tabs

For use outside of main navigation, a more compact tab component can be used.
