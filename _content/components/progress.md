# Progress

A Progress indicator signals that an application is busy performing an operation.

::: note
When operations take five seconds or longer to complete, add a progress feedback element to your design.
:::

## Rules of Thumb

- Use **Indeterminate Progress** mode to continually display unknown progress for an operation.
- Use **Determinate Progress** mode when an operation has a well-defined duration or a predictable end.
  Donâ€™t provide inaccurate time or percentage estimates if the precise completion time for the operation is unknown.

## Examples

![Do: Use an Indeterminate Progress control to indicate that an application is busy performing an operation but the progress is unknown.](/img/components/indeterminate-progress-do-1.png "Do: Use an Indeterminate Progress control to indicate that an application is busy performing an operation but the progress is unknown.")
