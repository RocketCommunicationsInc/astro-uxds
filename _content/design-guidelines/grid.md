# Grid

A grid system is a defined set of vertical columns and optionally horizontal rows based on time-tested principles of graphic design and layout. Ensuring a consistent grid system within your application and across all Astro applications creates a sense of continuity and relationship from screen to screen and app to app, even when the layouts between those screens may have dramatically different requirements.

## Columns, Gutters and Margins

The Astro Grid is a standard 12 column grid with column widths that expand or contract in relation to the width of the display. Columns are separated by a fixed-width gutter. Astro-compliant applications may use gutters of either 20 pixels (default) or 10 pixels (compact). The grid is enclosed by a fixed-width margin of 30 pixels.

## Breakpoints

At certain screen sizes, Astro optimizes for display on narrow devices by reducing the number of columns and rearranging the layout of your application via responsive design practices.

| Breakpoint | Columns | Margin | Cap  | Gap (compact) |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ---- | ------------- |
| 0-350px    | 4       | 20px   | 20px | 10px          |
| 351-768px  | 8       | 30px   | 20px | 10px          |
| 769px      | 12      | 30px   | 20px | 10px          |

::: note
CSS Grid is the recommended method for implementing a grid in your Astro project. Using a custom layout grid adds overhead and layers of incompatibility, and as such, should only be used if your project requires backwards-compatibility with Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.
