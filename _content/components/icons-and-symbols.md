# Icons and Symbols

Astro includes a library of common Icons, Symbols, and Notification Symbols. Persistent use of these will help ensure users are presented with consistent and meaningful information across applications.

Each of these must be easily identifiable by users and also be immediately distinguishable from each other, eliminating confusion and mistakes.

Astroâ€™s icons have been designed to utilize the Astro Status System.

::: note
Monitoring Icons must include a label, a title attribute in the HTML and a status indicator. When used in a light theme status indicators must also include a 1 pixel border around the status indicator set to rgba(0,0,0,0.5)

## Astro Icon Classes

### Monitoring Icons

These icons represent objects, equipment, and concepts that are being administered or monitored. The purpose of these icons is to easily, concisely, and clearly visually communicate their status to users.

![Example of different monitoring icon symbols](/img/components/icons-monitoring-2.png "Example of different monitoring icon symbols")

### Percentage Monitoring Icons

Percentage Monitoring Icons depict a value between 0 and 100 as an arc and a numeric display. Ranges within the arc may be mapped to the standard [Astro Status Colors](/patterns/status-system). In this example the range containing 80% is mapped to Serious.

### Action Icons

Action Icons initiate actions or state changes to objects or processes.

### Utility Icons

Utility Icons represent access to tools used to modify the settings for a component, object or globally. Utility Icons are also accompanied by a descriptive name.

### Component Icons

A Component Icon is a pictorial representation of an action associated with a screen component (i.e. - popup menu open/close or window expand/contract). The Component Icon graphic provides a guide to the action that will happen to the window component. Component Icon actions are enacted when selected or clicked.

## Astro Symbol Classes

Astro Symbols are associated with something being monitored and whose state is being communicated to the user. A user may make a setting change based on an items status, but the Status Symbol will only change if the status of the thing being monitored changes.

::: caution
Status Symbols are not to be altered as they are appended to icons for ADA 508 and WCAG 2.0 compliance.
:::

### Status Symbols

[Status Symbols](/components/status-symbol) include a shape and color that represent a particular state of an object, tool, concept, or action. An icon that indicates a state will be accompanied with a corresponding Status Color and Status Symbol. For more information see [Status System](/patterns/status-system).

### Lock/Unlock

A unique single purpose state indicator to identify whether an object or component is locked/unlocked.

![Astro lock/unlock example.](/img/components/icons-lock-unlock.png "Astro lock/unlock example.")

### Notification Symbols

Events that require some user attention, but no immediate response, may be indicated by changes to a Notification Symbol.

This Notification Symbol shows that five events related to a Satellite have occurred. You may hyperlink indicators to reveal a deeper view of relevant [Notification](/patterns/notifications) information. You may also link to the general Log.

### Labeling

An Icon may also include a Label and Sub-Label.

![Anatomy of icon label and sublable.](/img/components/icons-labeling.png "Anatomy of icon label and sublable.")

An Icon Label provides the name of the item being represented. An Icon Label should not change.

An Icon Sub-Label provides additional information to the user and may be dynamic. Use Sub-Labels only as needed to avoid unnecessary distraction.
