# Select Menu

When activated, Select Menus allow users to select a value from a list of values. Once a value is selected, the Select Menu displays the selected value.

## Rules of Thumb

- Selects should display a list of multiple values.
- Selects may default to a state that instructs users what to do. For example: “Select Modem” or a default choice like “Modem X.”
- When the user knows what they’re looking for in advance, consider using a text field with client-side auto-complete functionality instead.

## Appearance and Behavior

To learn more about adding Help Text or Validation to Select Menus, see the [Forms and Validation](/patterns/forms-and-validation) guidance.
